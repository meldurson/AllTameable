This is an overhaul and rewrite of [AllTameable](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/478?tab=description) from Buzz.

## DNA
* All tameable creates can now have random colour and traits.
* You can toggle both if you just want colour or just want traits.
* Same as everything else, when breeding will inherit with variance from parents ( *Requires [CLLC](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/CreatureLevelAndLootControl/)* )
* New equipment to show you a creature's DNA.
* The lower other physical stats, the easier it is to get higher in another stat.  
####
 
<details>
   <summary>Strength of Stat Effects</summary>
  
  | Main Stat    | Strong Effect (30%) | Medium Effect (20%) | Weak Effect (10%)|
  | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
  | Speed      | Armor     |Size | Health
  | Armor     | Speed     |Health | Size
  | Health     | Size     |Armor | Speed
  | Size    | Health     |Speed | Armor
  
  
  
  __Examples:__  
  *We will use a variance (configurable ) of 10%*
  *  If you two creatures with all traits at 100%, the range of the trait will +-10%.
  *  If you have two creatures with 50% Speed and 100% Armor, Health, and Size, since Speed has a Strong effect on Armor and Speed is low, the range of the Armor trait will +13%,-7.7%, for Size the range would be +12%,-8.3%, for Health the range would be +11%,-9%, and for Speed it would stay +-10%
  *  Oppositely, if you have a 150% Speed, 100% all others, the ranges will be, +7.7%,-13% for Armor, +8.3%,-12% for Size, -9%,+11% for Health
  *  This compounds will all traits, so if Speed, Armor, and Size are all 50% and Health is 150% the ranges would be:
     *   +17,-5.6 for Health: *(1.3x1.2x1.1=1.7 increase)* , *(0.77x0.83x0.9 = 0.56 decrease)*
     *   +14,-7 for Speed *1.3x1.2x0.9=1.4 increase* , *0.77x0.83x1.1 = 0.7 decrease*
     *   +12,-8.3 for Armor *1.3x0.83x1.1=1.2 increase* , *0.77x1.2x0.9=0.83 decrease*
     *   +10,-9.7 for Size *0.77x1.2x1.1=1 increase* , *1.3x0.83x0.9=0.97 decrease*
  * Detailed calculations for DNA can be found [here](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Meldurson/AllTameableTamingOverhaul/wiki/574-detailed-calculations-for-dna/)
 </details>  
 

* As the new DNA system is a major overhaul and is quite complex, if you have any issues, [let me know](https://github.com/meldurson/AllTameable/blob/main/README_New.md#contact) and I can try and fix them.
* If you have errors or do not want the DNA system you can disable it in the config.
* Also, if you have any suggestions on how the DNA system or the mod can be improved, feel free to make a suggestion [here](https://github.com/meldurson/AllTameable/discussions/2)

* If you have a Tamelist that you want to share, feel free to send it to me through Discord.

__Note:__ The new TameList <del>is optional</del> _is now required_, if you already have the original config file you do not need to download any extra files. The TameList file with override if it is found when loaded, otherwise the "meldurson.valheim.AllTameable.cfg" is used to create a new TameList.


### [Configuration](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Meldurson/AllTameableTamingOverhaul/wiki/572-how-to-format-the-tamelist/)
Explanation and overview of how to format the TameList can be found on the [wiki](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Meldurson/AllTameableTamingOverhaul/wiki/572-how-to-format-the-tamelist/)
and a more detailed version can be found [here](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Meldurson/AllTameableTamingOverhaul/wiki/573-in-depth-explanations-of-tamelist/)


### Known Incompatibilities:
* Issues with Valheim Plus Invincible Tames (throws an error, not game breaking)
* Tames entering WardIsLove wards can throw an error (Also not game breaking)


## Troubleshooting
__If a creature is not tameable when you think they should be then there are a steps you can take:__
1. When you start the game before the title screen there will be a block of messages saying which creatures have been set to tameable. The start of the message will be __[Info   :AllTameable-Overhaul]__ the name of the creature should be here with successfully added beside it. If it is not you may need to check your TameList
2. If you enable Debug Output in the __meldurson.valheim.AllTameable.cfg__ then when you load into the world it should show what creatures have successfully changed to be tameable and if they are commandable. This will be a block of  
__[Warning:AllTameable-Overhaul]__ Creature is commandable
__[Warning:AllTameable-Overhaul]__ Successfully added Tame and Procreation to Creature
3. If it says that the creature is tameable or commandable but does not show when in game, if you use the Taming Tool when Debug is enabled and hover over the creature it will show the Prefab name and if it is commandable. If the Prefab name is not in your Tamelist then you will have to add it.


__If a creature is not procreating then there are a couple steps you can take:__
1. Enable Debug in the __meldurson.valheim.AllTameable.cfg__
2. When hovering over the creature when they are fed it will bring up a few stats. 
   - The one you may need to look at is the Less than max instance: 
4. If it says Needs Mate then it will let you know the creatures that are around
5. If it says Error then it will post in Bepinex what the error is (Note: For 30s-1m after loading into a world there may be some errors with other mods that affect spawning that should go away)

   If none of that works, then reach out to me on the [Valheim Modding Discord](https://discord.com/invite/GUEBuCuAMz) 

### Contact:
The most reliable way to reach out would be to ping me in the [Valheim Modding Discord](https://discord.com/invite/GUEBuCuAMz) under @Meldurson or dm me on Discord.
